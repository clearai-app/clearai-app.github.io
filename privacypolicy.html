  <h1>Privacy Policy for Clear AI</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 21, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use the Service, and explains your privacy rights and how the law protects you.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or share any face data or personal images on our servers.</strong> A facial image is used solely for the purpose of analyzing skin condition and is stored only on your device. We (the developer) do not have access to your image. Scan results and saved images are never shared with third parties and remain private on your device unless you manually delete them.</p>

  <h2>Interpretation and Definitions</h2>
  <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Words capitalized here have meanings defined in the Definitions section.</p>
  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong><br>
  - Account: A unique account created to access our Service.<br>
  - Application: Refers to Clear AI.<br>
  - Company: Refers to Evan Club LLC, 60 Heather Drive.<br>
  - Country: United States (New York).<br>
  - Device: Any device that can access the Service.<br>
  - Personal Data: Information that identifies an individual.<br>
  - Service: Refers to the Clear AI Application.<br>
  - You: The individual using the Service.</p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <p>Clear AI does not collect personal data by default. Scan results, images, and task tracking data are stored locally on your device only. We do not transmit, back up, or access sensitive personal or facial data.</p>

  <h2 id="face-data">Face Data</h2>
  <p><strong>What is collected:</strong><br>
  When you initiate a skin scan, a facial image is captured to analyze skin clarity, tone, brightness, hydration, and texture. This image does not include biometric identifiers for authentication.</p>

  <p><strong>How it is used:</strong><br>
  The image may be securely transmitted to our private processing endpoint for real-time analysis. It is immediately deleted after processing and never stored or shared. The image and results are shown only to you within the app. Face data is not used for identity verification, advertising, or profiling.</p>

  <p><strong>Where is it stored:</strong><br>
  The facial image is saved locally on your device for your own viewing and use. It is never uploaded to a server. We (the developer) have no access to your stored image at any time. The data remains fully private on your device.</p>

  <p><strong>Is it shared?:</strong><br>
  No. The image is not shared with any third parties and is never transmitted outside your device beyond secure, temporary processing for analysis. All data remains private to your device.</p>

  <p><strong>How long is it retained?:</strong><br>
  The facial image is retained locally on your device as long as you choose to keep it. You can delete the app or clear in-app data at any time to remove it. We do not retain, collect, or store any face data on our servers.</p>

  <p><strong>Where is this explained?:</strong><br>
  This information is detailed in the section titled <a href="#face-data">"Face Data"</a> in this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>Usage Data</h2>
  <p>We may collect limited diagnostic information via Apple tools (such as TestFlight) to improve app performance. This data does not include any personal images, face data, or health information.</p>
  <p><strong>Diagnostic logs never include face images and are retained for up to 30 days on Apple’s crash-report servers for performance troubleshooting only.</strong></p>

  <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To generate personalized scan results and skin improvement tasks</li>
    <li>To provide on-device progress tracking</li>
    <li>To monitor and improve app stability and performance (non-personal diagnostic data only)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share your personal data or face data with any third parties under any circumstances.</p>

  <h2>Storage and Retention</h2>
  <p>Facial images are stored only locally on your device and never uploaded to any external servers. The data remains on your device until you delete it or remove the app. Any temporary processing that occurs through our API is encrypted and immediately deleted after analysis.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. All changes will be published on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
