  <h1>Privacy Policy for Clear AI</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 19, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use the Service and tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.</p>

  <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or share any face data or personal images.</strong> All image processing happens on-device or is temporarily sent to our API for analysis. We cannot and do not access, store, or associate this data with any user account. We only store task data, settings, and scan results locally on your device for your own in-app viewing and tracking.</p>

  <h2>Interpretation and Definitions</h2>
  <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Words capitalized here have meanings defined in the Definitions section.</p>
  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong><br>
  - Account: A unique account created to access our Service.<br>
  - Application: Refers to Clear AI.<br>
  - Company: Refers to Evan Club LLC, 60 Heather Drive.<br>
  - Country: United States (New York).<br>
  - Device: Any device that can access the Service.<br>
  - Personal Data: Information that identifies an individual.<br>
  - Service: Refers to the Clear AI Application.<br>
  - You: The individual using the Service.</p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <p>Clear AI does not collect any personal data by default. Scan results and progress tracking data are stored locally on your device. We do not access or back up any facial or sensitive health data to our servers.</p>

  <h2>Face Data</h2>
  <p><strong>What is collected:</strong> A facial image is temporarily captured to analyze skin condition and generate task suggestions.</p>
  <p><strong>How it is used:</strong> The image is processed using our machine learning model to generate skin improvement tasks. The results are shown only to you.</p>
  <p><strong>Is it stored or shared?:</strong> No. The facial image is not stored or saved on any server, and we do not share face data with third parties.</p>
  <p><strong>Where is it stored?:</strong> Temporarily via our API and never stored long term. Results are only saved on your device.</p>
  <p><strong>How long is it retained?:</strong> The image is discarded immediately after analysis. Scan results stay on-device until app deletion or user action.</p>

  <h2>Usage Data</h2>
  <p>We may collect limited diagnostic data through Apple tools (e.g., TestFlight) to improve stability. This never includes images, scans, or personal data.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide scan results and habit tasks personalized to you</li>
    <li>Improve app stability and performance</li>
    <li>Offer local progress tracking features</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share your data with third parties. Period.</p>

  <h2>Storage and Retention</h2>
  <p>Data is only stored on-device and used temporarily for API processing. No facial image data is stored.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy. Updates will appear here.</p>
